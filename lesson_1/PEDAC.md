**PEDAC** is a process for problem-solving in programming. It helps you avoid the mistake of programming without intent. 

#### What does it stand for?

**P** **-** (Understand the ) Problem
**E -** **E**xamples / Test cases
**D -** **D**ata Structure
**A -** Algorithm
**C -** **C**ode

In this course only the **P and A** of the ***PEDAC*** process will be discussed.

### P => Understanding the Problem

This includes 3 steps:
1. Reading the Problem Description
2. Check the test cases
3. Ask the interviewer or person for clarity if needed

Structure this part by writing down the input(s) and output for the solution followed by the rules you need to follow for the solution.

### D => Data Structure / Algorithm
