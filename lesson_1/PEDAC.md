**PEDAC** is a process for problem-solving in programming. It helps you avoid the mistake of programming without intent. 

#### What does it stand for?

**P** **-** *(Understand the ) Problem*
**E -** *Examples / Test cases*
**D -** *Data Structure*
**A -** *Algorithm*
**C -** *Code*

### P ➡️ Understanding the Problem

This includes 3 steps:
1. Reading the Problem Description
2. Ask the interviewer or person for clarity if needed

Structure this part by writing down the ***input(s) and output(s)*** for the solution followed by the the ***implicit and explicit rules*** you need to follow for the solution.

##### Recap:
- Read the problem description
- Ask for clarifying details
- Write down inputs and outputs
- Write down the implicit and explicit rules for the solution

### E ➡️ Examples & Test Cases

- Define test cases that will confirm you've found a solution. 

### D ➡️ Data Structure / Algorithm
