This repo is where I will store all my notes from the RB110 and RB119 courses at Launch School.

### What is this repo?

This repo is actually a collection of Obsidian notes. This means notes will be taken in the note taking app, Obsidian, and then the changes made in this Obsidian Vault will be pushed to GitHub as a repo for version control. 

In this repo you may see syntax using double square brackets, `[[ ]]` .

Between these square brackets will be titles of other files within this repo. In Obsidian the titles held between these double square brackets will be hyperlinked to the corresponding file in the vault. 

Because I haven't figured out how to make render these links in plain GitHub-flavoured markdown, the titles contained between the `[[ ]]]` on the raw Markdown files here on GitHub will not be hyperlinked. If you want to see what files these titles link to you must manually search the repo to find that file.

**Hope this helps!**
